 The amount of brown sugar in my cookie batter is a conserved quantity.
     notesForNextTime{(next time say ``I have added all the ingredients to the bowl, but have not started
    mixing.'')}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \pts{1} Write an equation describing the brown sugar density,
            $b$.

          \emph{Solution}
          
          For any conserved quantity, $Q$, the flux of the density of that
          across some surface becomes $q \vec{v}$.

          So $$\dbd{}{t}\int q dV = -\int q\vec{v}\cdot d\vec{a}\nn$$

          So $$\dbd{q}{t} + \nabla \cdot q \vec{v} = 0$$
          after a post-Gauss-theorem-smack-down.

      \item \pts{1} Then I start adding more at some rate, $R(x,t)$.  Update
          the above equation.

          \emph{Solution}
          $$\dbd{q}{t} + \nabla \cdot q \vec{v} = R(x,t)$$

  \end{enumerate}
