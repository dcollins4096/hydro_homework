  \pts{2} Why is the curl of the gravitational force zero?

\solution{
    \emph{Solution}

%    \red{Note that I want to see a statement like ``curl of grad is zero''.}

    Gravitational force is the gradient of a scalar field (like all conservative
    forces.)  

    The curl of a gradient is zero
