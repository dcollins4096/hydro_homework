   \pts{3} I threw two bottles in the ocean, with messages in them.  
    How does their relative velocity evolve with their separation? Assume the
correlation length of the ocean is 5 km, and they begin 1 m apart.


\solution{
     \emph{Solution:}
 
     $v_\ell^2 \approx \ell^{2/3}$, so as they get farther apart, the velocity
     difference should increase with distance, thus time.
}
