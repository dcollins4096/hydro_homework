Jeans Length Cheap.
     \begin{enumerate}
         \item \pts{4} The \emph{free fall time}, $t_{\rm{ff}}$, is the time for a sphere of gas with uniform
       density to collapse to a point, ignoring all forces except gravity.  Using dimensional analysis, write down the
       form that the free fall time must take, assuming it only depends on $G$ and
       $\rho_0$.  (For future reference, the missing constant is $\sqrt{3
       \pi/32}$)
   \item \pts{4} How long does it take for a sound wave to cross a sphere of
       length $L$, given a sound speed of $c_s$?
   \item \pts{4} What is the largest thing that can be supported against
       gravitational collapse by sound waves?  This is the Jeans Length.
       \end{enumerate}

   \emph{Solution}

    a.)   $t_{\rm{ff}} = (G \rho)^{-1/2}$

    b.) $c_s = L/t_{cross}$ or $t_{cross} = L/c_s$

    c.) $t_{cross} > t_{ff}$ for collapse.  Thus $L/c_s > 1/\sqrt(G \rho)$ or
    \begin{align}
        L_{jeans } \sim \frac{c_s}{\sqrt{G \rho}}
    \end{align}
