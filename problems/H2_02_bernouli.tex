\pts{2} If you blow over the top of a bottle, by how much does the pressure inside the
bottle drop relative to the ambient pressure?  Use Bernouli's equation.  Estimate or look up any numbers you may
need, please cite sources for numbers.      

\solution{
\emph{Solution}

Begin with the equation:
\begin{align}
	\half \rho v^2 + P + g h = const
\end{align}

We're blowing over the top of a bottle.  The important aspect of the flow as far
as the pressure is concerned is just the velocity, the height of the bottle is
irrelevant as the flow is not entering the bottle.  

One can blow at about 10 m/s.  The density of air is 1.2 $kg/m^3$.  The ambient
pressure is $1 atm = 1\times 10^{5} Pa$. 
\begin{align}
	\half \rho_1 v_1^2 + P_1 = P_2
\end{align}
$P_2$ is the pressure of the ambient air, and $P_1$ is the pressure in the
stream of moving air.  
\begin{align}
	P_1&=P_2-\half\rho v_1^2\\
	&1\times 10^5 Pa - 63.7 Pa
\end{align}
so the pressure is reduced by a small amount.
