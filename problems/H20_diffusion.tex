   Random-walk type processes are governed by diffusion,
      $$\dbd{n}{t} = D \frac{d^2 n}{d x^2}$$.
      This is good when the processes is independent of things like position and
      velocity.  
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item \pts{3} Show that $$n(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D t}}\exp{\left(\frac{-x^2}{4 D
              t}\right)}$$ is a solution to the diffusion equation.  
              %Don't work
              %too hard, use whatever free internet tools might help you take
              %derivatives.
          \item \pts{3} Show that the mean-square position of the material
              increases linear with time, i.e.  $\int x^2
              n(x,t) dx = 2 D t$.  
              %Similarly use all the tools available.
          \item Be amazed that $x^2\propto t$ for this diffusion process, but
              $\ell^2 \propto t^3$ for the turbulent process.
      \end{enumerate}

       I'll write up a full solution if there is interest.
