   Random-walk type processes are governed by diffusion,
   \begin{align}
	   \dbd{n}{t} = D \frac{d^2 n}{d x^2}.\label{eqn.diffusion}
   \end{align}
      \begin{enumerate}
          \item \pts{3} Show that $$n(x,t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \pi D t}}\exp{\left(\frac{-x^2}{4 D
              t}\right)}$$ is a solution to the diffusion equation.  
              %Don't work
              %too hard, use whatever free internet tools might help you take
              %derivatives.
          \item \pts{3} Show that the mean-square position of the material
              increases linear with time, i.e.  $\int x^2
              n(x,t) dx = 2 D t$.  
      \item \pts{3} Assume you have a long metal rod, and you heat a small
	      region at $x=0$.  This is described by Equation
	      \ref{eqn.diffusion}, where $n$ is then interpreted as a
	      temperature.  One can rewrite the equation for $T$.  Sketch
	      $T(x,t)$ for several values of time.
              %Similarly use all the tools available.
          %\item Be amazed that $x^2\propto t$ for this diffusion process, but
          %    $\ell^2 \propto t^3$ for the turbulent process.
      \end{enumerate}

       I'll write up a full solution if there is interest.
