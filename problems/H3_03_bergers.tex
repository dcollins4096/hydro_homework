\pts{4} Berger's equation is Euler's equation without the pressure.  
\begin{align}
\dbd{u}{t} + u \dbd{u}{x}=0
\end{align}
where $u$ is velocity (and not constant).
Use method
of charachteristics to show that, if
\begin{align}
u(x, t=0) = -m x +b,
\end{align}
where $m$ and $b$ are constants, then
\begin{align}
u(x,t) = \frac{ b-mx}{1-mt}.
\end{align}
At what time does $u=\infty$?
