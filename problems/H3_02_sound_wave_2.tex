Let us derive sound waves.
\begin{enumerate}
%\item \pts{2} List the steps necessary to derive the dispersion relation for
%sound waves.
\item \pts{3} Begin with $\rho_0$, $P_0$ constant and $v_0=0$.  Linearize
Continuity and Euler around these quantities
\item \pts{3} Get rid of Pressure using Density.  What assumptions do you need
to make?
\item \pts{2} Combine those equations into one equation for density.
\item \pts{3} Use Fourier Analysis to write a dispersion relation for $\omega$
and $k$.
\item \pts{3} Find the group and phase speed.
\end{enumerate}
