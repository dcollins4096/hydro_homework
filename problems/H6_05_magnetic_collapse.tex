    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \pts{4} Given a sphere of gas, show that the ratio of its magnetic
   energy to its gravitational binding energy is conserved.
    \item \pts{2} If magnetic fields support a cloud of pre-stellar gas (i.e.
        the magnetic energy is larger than the gravitational), what
    must happen if the gas is to fulfil its destiny as an actual star?
    \end{enumerate}

\solution{
     \emph{Solution}
 
     (a) 
     \begin{align}
       E_g &= a M^2 R^{-1} \nn\\
       E_b &= b B^2 R^{3} \nn\\
       \frac{E_g}{E_b} &= c \frac{M^2}{B^2 R^4} \nn\\
       &= c\frac{M^2}{\Phi^2}\nn
     \end{align}
     where a, b, and c are constants of order unity (5/3 and 4/3 $\pi$).  Since
     mass and magnetic flux are conserved, change in size of a cloud cannot
     change the magnetic support: once it's supported, it's always supported.
 
     (b) Either mass needs to be added along the field (but that's slow, and
     likely in pressure balance) or flux needs to be removed by non-ideal
     effects (this breaks Flux Freezing.)
