   Spherical accretion is characterized by a velocity field
    $$\vvec = \frac{\dot{M}}{r^2} \hat{r},$$
    where $\dot{M}$ is the accretion rate (will find that later in the course).
    This is, for instance, gas falling onto a small planet.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \pts{4} Find $\nabla \times \vvec$.   What does that tell you about the field?  

	      \solution{
          \emph{Solution}
 

        $$\nabla\times\vvec = 0$$
        Possible solutions are taking the derivative, or noting that curls only
        contain tangential derivatives, and this has only longitudinal
        variation:  or, by fully taking the curl. (3 pts)

        We learn that this type of flow has not rotational motions.  (1 pt)
	}

      \item \pts{4} Find $\divv$. What does that tell you about the field?  

\solution{
         \emph{Solution}
         $$\nabla\cdot\vvec= \frac{1}{r^2} \dbd{r^2 v_r}{r}  $$
         plus terms that involve $v_\phi$ and $v_\theta$, which are not present.  
         \begin{align}
             \nabla\cdot\vvec = \frac{1}{r^2} \dbd{}{r}\left( r^2
             \frac{\dot{M}}{r^2} \right) = 4 \pi \dot{M} \delta^3(\vec{r})
         \end{align}
 
         so there is only divergence at a single point, the origin.

          \red{I didn't take points off for getting the $\delta(r)$ wrong
          because I had not covered it.}
          %But do learn this solution.}
