 \label{sound_problem}  \pts{15} Starting with a uniform $\rho_0,\ P_0,\ v_0$, derive the
    dispersion relation for acoustic waves.  Try it without looking at the book.

\solution{
    \emph{Solution:}

    This is directly from the book.  Please let me know if you would like a more
    complete solution.
%%    Hints are on the next page.\begin{enumerate}
%%    \item \pts{3} Expand the continuity equation and equation of motion into "mean and
%%      fluctuating" parts: $\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1$, $v=v_0+v_1$, $p=p_0+p_1$.
%%      Assume $\nu=0$ and all external forces are zero, but do not assume that
%%      the mean parts ($\rho_0, v_0, p_0$) are uniform or that the fluctuating
%%      parts are small, or that derivatives are zero.  Fully expand each term.
%%    \item  \pts{0} The purpose of leaving every term in will become more
%%      clear when you do this either in an expanding medium, or in Chapter 8
%%      when we study turbulence and the fluctuating parts aren't small.  (This
%%      is not actually a question.)
%%    \item \pts{2} Now, assume that $\rho_0$ and $p_0$ are spatially uniform and
%%      constant in time, and that $v_0=0$.  What's left?
%%    \item \pts{2} Now throw out second order terms.  What's left?
%%    \item \pts{2}  Eliminate $p_1$ using $c^2=\frac{dp}{d\rho}$
%%    \item \pts{2} Eliminate the velocity by taking the time derivative of the
%%      continuity equation, and the spatial derivative of the equation of
%%      motion and combining.  
%%    \item \pts{0} Now you should have something that looks like 6.18 from the book.
%%    \item \pts{2} Assume $\rho_1 = A \exp[ i(k x - \omega t)]$.  Insert this into what
%%      you just got, to get a relation between $\omega$ and $k$.  
%%    \item \pts{2} Explain why we are justified in calling $\sqrt{\frac{dp}{d\rho}}$
%%      the sound speed.

%%
%%      \emph{Solution:}
%%
%%      For parts a)-h), points were lost for not expanding everything (why I
%%      wanted this should be clear when we take the ensemble averages.)  
%%
%%      For part i), $c=\sqrt{\dbd{p}{\rho}}$ because this is the phase speed,
%%      $\omega/k=c$, the speed at which $exp{i(k x - \omega t)}$ propagates,
%%      which would be equal to $\sqrt{\dbd{p}{\rho}}$.
